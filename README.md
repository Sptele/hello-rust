# Hello Rust!

I'm learning rust, and this is my repository to store everything I gain.

I am using (The Book)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/] and (The Learn By Example)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/]

Overall, Rust is a great language. It has transformative ideas that are very interesting to me,
and the concept of Ownership and Borrowing, eliminating the Garbage Collector, is pretty cool.

The syntax is very clean and efficient, and powerful. I can do many things easily and efficiently (one-liners!),
and I love the `impl <trait> for <struct>` system. Enums have methods!

I hope to use rust in the future. It's a pretty cool language, with cool ideas.
